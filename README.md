nodejs-playing-around
 This project is meant to be a place where I can test out some NodeJS ideas and how to use certain packages and features.It'll also include some general Web Development information because I'm using it to learn how to utilize NodeJS better.


 MVC Basics

 View - Visual representation of our app, window into the application as end users

 Controller -  Waits for http, delegates business logic to Models and Services, returns a meaningful response.

 Model - Handels the connection to the database and the queries that are sent to it.

 Models are basically Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tools.

 CRUD Apps - Create, Read, Update and Delete

 Typically they don't include a lot of business logic
